Events from external and internal event sources are channeled through a trigger, and rules allow actions to react to these events. </p>\n<p>Actions can be small snippets of Javascript or Swift code, or custom binaries embedded in a Docker container. Actions in OpenWhisk are instantly deployed and executed whenever a trigger fires. The more triggers fire, the more actions get invoked. If no trigger fires, no action code is running, so there is no cost.</p>\n<p>In addition to associating actions with triggers, it is possible to directly invoke an action by using the OpenWhisk API, CLI, or iOS SDK. A set of actions can also be chained without having to write any code. Each action in the chain is invoked in sequence with the output of one action passed as input to the next in the sequence.</p>",
