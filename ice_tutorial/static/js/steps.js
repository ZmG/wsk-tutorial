Data volumes provide several useful features for persistent or shared data:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Volumes are initialized when a container is created. If the container's base image contains data at the specified mount point, that data is copied into the new volume.</li>\n  <li>Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.</li>\n  <li>Changes to a data volume are made directly.</li>\n  <li>Changes to a data volume will not be included when you update an image.</li>\n  <li>Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the container's life cycle.
